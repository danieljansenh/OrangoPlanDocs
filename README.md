After installing the plug-in using the Package Manager or download it from Food4Rhino and restarting Rhino, you'll find the toolbox in Grasshopper toolbar.

OrangoPlan provides parametric tools to model, analyze, and visualize complex urban design workflows. It enables designers and planners to create adaptive street networks, land-use layouts, building massing, public space configurations, and infrastructure simulations. 
The plugin supports data-driven decision-making by integrating speadsheets, regulatory planning factors, and metric based parameters to optimize urban form, livability, and sustainability. Ideal for master planning, zoning studies, and rapid prototyping of urban-scale interventions.
